# arkswift: Forging Swift Mastery

Welcome to **arkswift**! This repository is my personal forge for mastering the Swift programming language—starting from the basics and building towards advanced concepts.


## About This Repository

- The `programiz` directory contains my foundational learning and practice, following the basics of Swift as taught by Programiz.
- As I progress, I will add learnings, code samples, and notes from other resources to cover more advanced topics and real-world Swift development.
- The goal is to create a comprehensive, ever-evolving "ark" of Swift knowledge—where each file and folder represents a new skill, experiment, or insight.


## Why "arkswift"?

Just as an ark preserves and carries valuable things forward, this repository is where I collect, shape, and strengthen my Swift skills through hands-on practice, experimentation, and continuous learning.


## Future Plans

- Expand beyond basics to include advanced Swift features, best practices, and patterns.
- Integrate learnings from books, courses, and real-world projects.
- Share insights, tips, and code snippets for others on the same journey.
